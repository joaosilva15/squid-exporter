Squid Prometheus exporter
--------------------------

Exports squid metrics in Prometheus format

**NOTE**: From release 1.0 metric names and some parameters has changed. Make sure you check the docs and update your deployments accordingly!

Usage:
------
Simple usage:

    squid-exporter -squid-hostname "localhost" -squid-port 3128

Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from `localhost:9301/metrics`

    - job_name: squid
      # squid-exporter is installed, grab stats about the local
      # squid instance.
      target_groups:
        - targets: ['localhost:9301']

To get all the parameteres

    squid-exprter -help


Usage with docker:
------
Basic setup assuming Squid is running on the same machine:

    docker run --net=host -d boynux/squid-exporter

Setup with Squid running on a different host

    docker run -p 9301:9301 -d boynux/squid-exporter -squid-hostname "192.168.0.2" -squid-port 3128 -listen ":9301"
